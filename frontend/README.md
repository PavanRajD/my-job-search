## How to Get Started (Step by Step)

### 1. Install Docker Desktop
- Download Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- Install it and make sure it is running (look for the Docker whale icon on your computer).

### 2. Get the App Code
- Click the green "Code" button on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/your-username/my-job-search) and copy the link.
- Open your computer's Terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows).
- Type these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-job-search.git
cd my-job-search
```

### 3. Set Up Google AI (Gemini)
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create a project (or use an existing one).
- Search for "Generative Language API" and enable it.
- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials** and create an API key.
- Copy your API key.

### 4. Add Your Google API Key
- Open the folder `my-job-search/backend`.
- Find the file named `.env` (it is already created for you).
- Open `.env` with Notepad or any text editor.
- Find the line that says:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
```

- Paste your Google API key after the `=` sign, like this:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

- Save the file.

### 5. Start the App
- In your Terminal, make sure you are in the `my-job-search` folder.
- Type this command to start everything:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Wait a few minutes. When it says the frontend is running, open your web browser and go to:

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

- You can now use the app!

### 6. Stopping the App
- When you are done, go back to your Terminal and press `Ctrl+C` to stop.
- To fully shut down and clean up, type:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

**That's it!**
- You do not need to install anything else.
- You do not need to run any other commands.
- Just update the `.env` file if you ever need to change your Google API key.

If you have any trouble, ask someone to help you with Docker or Google Cloud setup.
